1).Optimization Problems:-->
    A problem which requires either minimum result or maximum result
    For any problem there can be only 1 optimal solution(minimal cost)
    Methods to find answer for optimization problems are as follows:
    a).Greedy Algorithm
    b).Dynamic Programming
    c).Branch and Bound

2).Greedy Approach:
    It says that a problem should be solved in stages, In each stage we will consider
    one input from given problem and if that input is feasible then we will include it in the solution, by including all
    the feasible inputs we will get the optimal solution
